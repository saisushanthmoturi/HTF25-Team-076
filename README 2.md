from incremental_lora_learning import IncrementalUpdateService

# Initialize service
service = IncrementalUpdateService(
    model_path="./models/logbert_model.pt",
    tokenizer_path="./models/tokenizer.pkl"
)

# Update with new benign traffic
service.update_model(new_logs, epochs=3)
```

chmod +x /Users/majjipradeepkumar/Downloads/samplewar/test_traffic.sh
./test_traffic.sh
```

### Manual Traffic Patterns for ML Training

curl "http://localhost:8080/ecommerce/search?q=laptop"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"productId":1,"quantity":2}' "http://localhost:8080/ecommerce/cart"

# Suspicious patterns for anomaly detection training
curl "http://localhost:8080/ecommerce/search?q='; DROP TABLE products; --"
curl -X POST -d "username=admin' OR '1'='1" "http://localhost:8080/ecommerce/login"

# REST API patterns
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer fake_token" "http://localhost:8080/rest-api/api/admin"
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/rest-api/api/tasks/../../../../etc/passwd"
```

## 📊 Access Log Analysis

### Log Location
Tomcat access logs are generated at:
```
/Users/majjipradeepkumar/Downloads/apache-tomcat-9.0.109/logs/localhost_access_log.*.txt
```

### Log Format Features for ML Training
- **IP addresses**: Source identification  
- **Timestamps**: Temporal pattern analysis
- **HTTP methods**: Request type classification
- **URLs and parameters**: Path traversal and injection detection
- **Response codes**: Anomaly pattern recognition
- **User agents**: Bot detection and fingerprinting
- **Payload sizes**: Data exfiltration detection

## 🛡️ Security Testing Scenarios

### Implemented Attack Vectors
1. **SQL Injection**: Search parameters, login forms
2. **XSS Attacks**: Form inputs, comment systems
3. **Authentication Bypass**: Session manipulation, token forging
4. **File Upload Attacks**: Malicious file types, path traversal
5. **API Abuse**: Rate limiting, unauthorized access
6. **CSRF**: Form submissions, state changing operations

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Blog CMS (Optional)

The blog CMS application is deployed but returns 404. This is likely due to:
- JSP compilation issues
- Servlet mapping conflicts  
- Missing dependencies

**For immediate WAF training**, the two working applications (E-commerce + REST API) provide sufficient diverse traffic patterns.
